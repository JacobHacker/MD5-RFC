MD5-rfc1321.txt - contains the original text
rfc1321.html - contains the css-styles html version

I created the style for this by hand, and it's inline in the HTML. I made this
because I didn't like reading the original, which, in my opinion looks really
ugly, but you can compare for yourself.

In the future the process of converting an RFC could probably be automated.
